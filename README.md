# Football-Player-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Jupyter notebook using python to predict football player.

Football pLayer price prediction using various machine learning algorithm. The dataset used for this problem is collected from Kaggel. The dataset is provided.

For explanatory data analysis following graphs are used-
1.Histogram
2.Scatter Plot
3.Box Plot
4.Feature Heatmap

The system has been build using 80% data for trainning and 20% data for testing. 6 different type of Machine Learning algorithm has been integrated to predict the price. Such as-
1.Random Forest
2.XGBoost
3.Gradient Boost
4.Linear Regression
5.Support Vector Regression
6.ADA Boost Regression

There is also a feature for predicting specific player price taking input from the user.
